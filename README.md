# projectAdventure
A simple JS game that runs in the browser. Done as a hobby project by me (Victor). You are an adventurer exploring a big world, killing enemies and collecting stuff. You cannot win the game, but you can lose if your health gets really bad. My main inspiration is the latest Zelda-game (Breath of the Wild) and I want to explore how to generate a big world to explore.

### Current version features
- Walk around in a small, fixed world
- Collect pizza slices

### Project purpose
- Learn some new ES6 features
- Make a (hopefully) fun open world exploration game
- Learn how to work with the HTML5 canvas
- Think about how to generate big maps that the player can explore
