# projectAdventure
A simple JS game that runs in the browser. Done as a hobby project by me (Victor). You are an adventurer exploring a big world, killing enemies and collecting stuff. You cannot win the game, but you can lose if your health gets really bad.

### Game play features
- Exploring a new, big world every time you play
- Collect health, coins and a stronger sword
- Fight enemies with your sword

### Project purpose
- Learn some new ES6 features
- Make a fun open world exploration game
- Learn how to work with the canvas
- Think about how to generate big maps that the player can explore
